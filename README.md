# BookJar-Reccommender
 

 
 
 <p>The assignment we had was to develop Book manager and recommender. Similar to a comptition netflix had ran. Firstly
 We had to read in from a .dat file that we created then save that file in xml format on the program. The program allows us to enter and save new data into that xml file. Such as new users or book as well as search through that file using different types of data as its search key, adding/delting users etc.
